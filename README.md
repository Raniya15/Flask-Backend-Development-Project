This project is a web application that allows users to test regular expressions (regex) on custom input strings. Built using Python's Flask framework, the app provides a simple interface where users can input both a test string and a regex pattern, and the app will display whether the pattern matches the string.

Features:
Input a test string and a regex pattern.
Real-time feedback on whether the regex matches the test string.
User-friendly interface with form validation.
Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu).
